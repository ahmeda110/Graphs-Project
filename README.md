# Graphs-Project

In this Java Program, I implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path algorithm and prints the resulting paths. Moreover, I also implemented a parser to read a text file and construct an adjacency matrix graph.

1- Request the user for the name of a text file

2- Write a Parser to read the input file and adapt it to the source code (the parser should also initialize the adjacency matrix)

3- Write the output of the Java code to a text file
