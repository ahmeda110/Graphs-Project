# Graphs-Project

In this Java Program, I implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path algorithm and prints the resulting paths. Moreover, I also implemented a parser to read a text file and construct an adjacency matrix graph.

For example if a text file contained:

0 41   0 0 0 29 <br/>
0 0 51   0 32   0 <br/>
0 0 0 50   0 0 <br/>
45   0 0 0 0 38 <br/>
0 0 32   36   0 0 <br/>
0 29   0 0 21 0  <br/>

1- Request the user for the name of a text file

2- Write a Parser to read the input file and adapt it to the source code (the parser should also initialize the adjacency matrix)

3- Write the output of the Java code to a text file
